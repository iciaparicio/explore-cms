# Rows

This type of module is really geared towards presenting different tariffs to users although you can use it for any content that fits.

It is formatted in _rows_ where each one has several optional fields such as a small tag that acts as a title for that row, a short text and its corresponding link.

**How is the expiration date displayed?**

If you have enabled the option to show the expiration date, the way in which that date is displayed depends on the day on which the _card_ expires.

`ENDS TODAY hh:mm AM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm PM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm` \(format varies depending on the country\) to indicate that _card_ expires on the same day at the specified time, in the morning or in the afternoon, respectively. For example, `ENDS TODAY at 9:00 AM`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29.png)

`TOMORROW` indicates that the expiration date is the following day.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

`ENDS on dd mm` to indicate that the difference is more than two days. For example `ENDS on 30 JUN`.

Starting and Ending date and time is a way to program some campaigns and is specifically designed for seasonal campaigns.

**Card 1 Micro-segments**. Tags that you can add, always separated by commas, to make a segmentation of the users who are going to see the content you are creating.

ðŸ”…It is an **optional** field.

**Card 1 categories \(mandatory\)**

Categories allow you to filter content in Explore. The categories are shown at the top in a horizontal scroll bar, which allows the user to browse by category and choose the one they want to see.

When the user selects a category, the content is shown in a vertical format \(as opposed to having to scroll horizontally\), so that the user doesn't miss any content.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories_divices.png)

In Explore CMS, select the category or categories that apply to the card that you are configuring:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories.png)

* **Accessories**: Earphones, cases, watches.
* **Bundles**: Packs, plans, product packs.
* **Devices**:  Smartphones, tablets.
* **Loyalty**: Membership, loyalty/â€‹retention programmes content \(Vivo Valoriza, Priority, Club Movistar, etc.\)
* **Promos**: Promotional content that may apply and which may coexist with other categories.
* **Plans**: Tariffs, plans and plan upgrades.
* **Services**: Added value services \(new app features\), apps, other TEF services.
* **TV**: Television plans, featured content.

{% hint style="info" %}
The category **All**, which is the first one that you see, isn't a category as such. Rather, it is the way in which the user can view all the content.

By default, when a user opens Explore he/â€‹she sees all content and all configured cards. As such, the selected category is always **All**.
{% endhint %}

#### What should I consider when using the categories?

Consult the [**Categories**](https://app.gitbook.com/@tef-novum/s/explore-cms/%7E/drafts/-LyYX2WN5Qc794RVRWmG/faq#categorias) section of the [FAQ](../../faq.md) to resolve all of your doubts!

### Change the order of the _cards_

Inside the module, you can move the cards to change the order in which they are displayed.

### Banner

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2845%29.png)

For each _banner_ the available fields will vary depending on whether you select an image or a _bumper_:

* **Image**. It displays a static image.
* **Bumper**. It displays a short video or animation.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Image" %}

**Image Upload an image** ðŸ“¤. URL of the _banner_ image. This must be in the CMS's own URL format.

Click on the **Upload an image** ðŸ“¤ link and choose the image you want from your computer. Once the image upload has been processed, the URL will auto-complete in the text field.

When the image has been uploaded it is previewed just below.

ðŸ”… This is a **required** field.

**Image Accesibility Text**. Description of the image that is used for accessibility as an alternative if the image cannot be displayed \(for example, for people with vision problems\).

{% tab title="Bumper" %}
![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

**Bumper Upload a bumper** ðŸ“¤. It is auto-filled with the name of the _bumper_.

To upload a bumper you have two options:

1. Click on **Upload a bumper** ðŸ“¤ link and upload a _bumper_ from your computer.
2. Display the list of _bumpers_ and select one of those that have already been uploaded.

Activate the **Play in loop** option for the _bumper_ to be played in loop in Explore. If you leave it off, it will play every time the _bumper_ is on the screen, but once it has finished it will stop.

When the _bumper_ has been uploaded it is previewed just below:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2840%29.png)

**Bumper Accesibility Text**. Description of the _bumper_ that is used for accessibility as an alternative if the _bumper_ cannot be displayed \(for example, for people with vision problems\).

ðŸ”… It has no maximum length and is an **optional** field.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Action URL**. URL of the _banner_â€‹, i.e., the URL that can be accessed by clicking on the _banner_.

ðŸ”… This is a **required** field and has to be a valid URL \(for example: [`https://www.google.com`](https://www.google.com)\)

**Card Starting date and time**. Date and time you want the _banner_ to start being displayed to users.

ðŸ”… It is an optional field.

**Card Ending date and time**. Date and time you want the _banner_ to stop being displayed to users.

ðŸ”… It is an optional field.

**Card Micro-segments**. Tags that you can add, always separated by commas, to make a segmentation of the users who are going to see the content you are creating.

**Categories \(mandatory\)**

Categories allow you to filter content in Explore. The categories are shown at the top in a horizontal scroll bar, which allows the user to browse by category and choose the one they want to see.

When the user selects a category, the content is shown in a vertical format \(as opposed to having to scroll horizontally\), so that the user doesn't miss any content.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories_divices.png)

In Explore CMS, select the category or categories that apply to the card that you are configuring:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories_banner.png)

* **Accessories**: Earphones, cases, watches.
* **Bundles**: Packs, plans, product packs.
* **Devices**:  Smartphones, tablets.
* **Loyalty**: Membership, loyalty/â€‹retention programmes content \(Vivo Valoriza, Priority, Club Movistar, etc.\)
* **Promos**: Promotional content that may apply and which may coexist with other categories.
* **Plans**: Tariffs, plans and plan upgrades.
* **Services**: Added value services \(new app features\), apps, other TEF services.
* **TV**: Television plans, featured content.

{% hint style="info" %}
The category **All**, which is the first one that you see, isn't a category as such. Rather, it is the way in which the user can view all the content.

By default, when a user opens Explore he/â€‹she sees all content and all configured cards. As such, the selected category is always **All**.
{% endhint %}

#### What should I consider when using the categories?

Consult the [**Categories**](https://app.gitbook.com/@tef-novum/s/explore-cms/%7E/drafts/-LyYX2WN5Qc794RVRWmG/faq#categorias) section of the [FAQ](../../faq.md) to resolve all of your doubts!

### Link

**Name**. Name of the link \(for example `Benefits`\).

# Edit Module

To edit an existing module in Explore CMS and save an updated version of the module, go to the modules repository and click on ![](https://github.com/iciaparicio/explore-cms/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/icono_editar.png?raw=true) the row of the corresponding module.

The fields will either be filled in or empty depending on the configuration of the module. You can modify the information in any of the completed fields or add additional information in the empty fields.

To save the changes and generate a new version of the module, click **SAVE**. To discard the changes and leave the current version unaltered, click **CANCEL**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only the layout can be published, not the modules. Therefore, if you want the changes you have made to a module to be seen in the app, you need to [publish the layout](../layout/publicar-layouts.md) or layouts where this module is available.
{% endhint %}

If the module you are editing is being used in a layout, you can see which layout\(s\) it is being used in from the **Details &gt; Layouts**.

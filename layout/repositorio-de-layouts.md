# Layouts repository

List of layouts available in Explore CMS. This list varies depending on the segmentation of your OB. It is important to be aware that you cannot create new layouts. What you can do is edit each of the corresponding layouts and indicate, for each layout, which modules you wish to display from the modules you have created.

The layouts repository includes information about:

**LAYOUT**. Title of the layout that describes the segments affected.

**STATUS**. Layout status that informs you of the latest changes applied to the layout and its current status. The available statuses are:

- **PUBLISHED**. The layout version is currently public and is the one that users are viewing.
- **MODIFIED**. The layout version is a version with changes pending publication. Users will not see these changes until the layout is published.

{% hint style="info" %} In the **MODIFIED** status, if you have provided a MSISDN and a valid telephone number to the NOVUM team of your OB, you can view the layout in the app so that they can include it in a special list (*white list*). {% endhint %}

**ACTIONS**. From the icon ![](https://github.com/iciaparicio/explore-cms/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/icono_editar.png?raw=true) you can access layout module editing.

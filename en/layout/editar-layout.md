# Edit layout

Keep in mind that a layout is a content unit made up of several modules. The full composition of modules is what the user sees in the app. This layout is based on the user segments or combination of user segments for whom the content is intended (prepay, postpay, operating system).

The layouts currently available depend on the OB and their characteristics.

In order to edit an existing layout in Explore CMS and be able to publish it, go to the layouts repository and click ![](../.gitbook/assets/icono_editar.png) on the row of the corresponding layout.

In the header of the layout building mode, you can find information about:

**Segment**. Layout segment: **Prepay** or **Postpay**.

**Operating System.** Operating system of the segment for which the layout is intended: **iOS** or **Android**.

## Layout building

From this section, you can configure the layout, indicating the modules that you will display and the order of the modules when the user sees them from Explore. You can also create a module from here.

### How to change the order of a module in the layout

In the list, click on the ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VzfjcfEIrPHTLjp_bPrzRkNxpTM4IcMOY2uwN0-ZS4mQqX_ySYoDGL7-FUbKaEPhwY0IQsrvaqGokR0qdpReVgjg-F3U6rLteuZDl3Wc4wpmFbK2sy9Kq7hiaIh5faycHrlgB2ED) arrows to lower and raise the position of the module.

{% hint style="danger" %} Remember that a [*Featured Content*](../modulo/crear-modulo/featured-content.md)-type module must always occupy the first position. {% endhint %}

### How to add a module from layouts editing

Select the module you wish to add from the drop-down menu.

### How to delete a module from a layout

In order for a module not to be displayed in a layout, click on the icon ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/q0qzCAHIyMnv9dyt1hP6CQAHLrJGow0i9F0V5Eee4bWiyqX8RTP2Q7ZYTiXTEOSYO9yyk3hxZIldCKjYgQUDM4bKJK-G9K4i0mPjYGhWacvIkKvvztVn2k_d5tyVKrz55H9TZm9j) of the corresponding module.

Click **DELETE** to accept the message displayed on the screen and confirm that you want to delete the text.

{% hint style="danger" %} The action of deleting a module from a layout does not delete the module from the modules repository and you can therefore use it at another time if necessary. {% endhint %}

When you have finished editing the layout, click on the **DONE** button.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %} By clicking **DONE** the layout is edited but not yet published. {% endhint %}

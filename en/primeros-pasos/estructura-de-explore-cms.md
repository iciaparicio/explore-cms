# Explore CMS structure

## Module

**Modules** are the basic and minimum structures that make up Explore. Configure each module to define the different offers or products that you want to display in Explore.

## Layouts

**Layouts** consist of a set of modules. A layout is configured taking into account customer segmentation (prepay, postpay, hybrid, operating system). Use the modules to configure the layout, selecting which modules and in which order you want to display them in Explore.

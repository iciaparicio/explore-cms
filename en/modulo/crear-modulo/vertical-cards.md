# Vertical Cards

This type of module is used to display several elements in vertical format. It is very useful for presenting products offers, for example.

It is displayed as a carousel offering links on each *card* as well as optional elements like a tag on the image or a link to an entire list (a ‚ÄúSee all‚Äù).

`ENDS TODAY hh:mm AM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm PM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm` (format varies depending on the country) to indicate that *card* expires on the same day at the specified time, in the morning or in the afternoon, respectively. For example, `ENDS TODAY at 9:00 AM`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2855%29.png)

`TOMORROW` indicates that the expiration date is the following day.

`ENDS on dd mm` to indicate that the difference is more than two days. For example `ENDS on 30 JUN`.

**Card 1 categories (mandatory)**

Categories allow you to filter content in Explore. The categories are shown at the top in a horizontal scroll bar, which allows the user to browse by category and choose the one they want to see.

When the user selects a category, the content is shown in a vertical format (as opposed to having to scroll horizontally), so that the user doesn't miss any content.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories_divices.png)

In Explore CMS, select the category or categories that apply to the card that you are configuring:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories.png)

- **Accessories**: Earphones, cases, watches.
- **Bundles**: Packs, plans, product packs.
- **Devices**:  Smartphones, tablets.
- **Loyalty**: Membership, loyalty/‚Äãretention programmes content (Vivo Valoriza, Priority, Club Movistar, etc.)
- **Promos**: Promotional content that may apply and which may coexist with other categories.
- **Plans**: Tariffs, plans and plan upgrades.
- **Services**: Added value services (new app features), apps, other TEF services.
- **TV**: Television plans, featured content.

{% hint style="info" %} The category **All**, which is the first one that you see, isn't a category as such. Rather, it is the way in which the user can view all the content.

By default, when a user opens Explore he/she sees all content and all configured cards. As such, the selected category is always **All**. {% endhint %}

#### What should I consider when using the categories?

Consult the [**Categories**](https://app.gitbook.com/@tef-novum/s/explore-cms/%7E/drafts/-LyYX2WN5Qc794RVRWmG/faq#categorias) section of the [FAQ](../../faq.md) to resolve all of your doubts!

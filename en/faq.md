# FAQs

## Can a module be in several layouts at the same time?

Yes, absolutely. It is therefore worth bearing in mind that the changes you make to a module can affect several layouts.

When editing a module, you can see which layout or layouts it is included in:

## I only want to change one detail of a module for one layout but that module is also in use in another layout; what can I do?

If you only want that change to affect one layout then create another identical module that also includes the detail you wish to modify. You will then have created two modules. Use the module you need in each layout.

{% hint style="info" %} For example

*I have the layouts **Layout android prepay** and **Layout ios prepay**. Both layouts contain the **Rows Club Movistar** module:*

*I have decided that some of the information I wish to display about the price is not the same for Android as it is for iOS.*

*What should I do?*

In this case, you need to create a new module. Call it, for example, *Club Movistar iOS*. The configuration will be the same as the module you already had (*Club Movistar*) but with modified pricing information for iOS, just as you wanted.

Then, once you have created this module, go to the layout repository and edit **Layout ios prepay**. Delete the **Row Club Movistar** module and add the new **Row Club Movistar iOS** module that you have created. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %} Remember to put the modules in the order you wish them to appear, taking into account the fact that the new module you have created will appear last. {% endhint %}

## I have made a change to a module and I want to publish it. Where do I do this from?

The fact is that you publish the layout rather than the modules. The reason for this is simple: a change to a module can affect several layouts at the same time and that may not be your intention. That is why you always publish layouts.

## I have made changes to a layout but I have not yet published them. Can I preview the changes before making them visible to all users?

Yes, of course you can do it. Click on this link ðŸ‘‡

## I want to create a new layout; how do I do it?

You cannot create a new layout as the layouts are already configured depending on the segmentation of your customers. Remember, operating system, payment model.

## I want to use a *Featured Content* module but I would like it to be seen after another module that I had created. Is it possible to place it in any position?

Of course. You can place it in any position you want within the layout. Of course, bear in mind that the title shown in this case is the one you defined in the **Section Title** field.

{% hint style="warning" %} Bear in mind that a *Featured Content*â€‹-type module must always occupy the first position, regardless of whether you use more of this type in your layout composition. {% endhint %}

## I don't have a username to log in to Explore CMS, how do I get one?

Contact your NOVUM team directly. They will manage your login.

## Categories

In this section, you can resolve all of your doubts regarding the configuration of categories, learning how to configure them in the optimum manner:

### Does all the Explore CMS content need to be categorised?

Yes, that's right. All the content needs to be assigned to at least one category.

### Can I edit, create or delete a category in Explore CMS?

No, it's not possible to create, rename or delete any of the existing categories from Explore CMS. But don't worry, because the categories that you can select have been agreed with your OB, meaning you won't need to create new categories.

If you still feel that there is content that doesn't apply to any of the available categories, please feel free to contact your OB manager for him/â€‹her to forward your request to the NOVUM team. They will make a joint decision as to whether or not a change is necessary.

### I've seen that there are many predefined categories in Explore CMS, but I don't need all of them.

Don't worry. If there's a category that you don't need, don't use it. In this case, the category won't be shown to the user.

### Can I use one category for all my content?

No, you need to use at least 3 of the proposed categories. If you use just 1 or 2 categories, the filtered content will be almost the same as the unfiltered content.

Anyway, you're bound to have some really interesting content that applies to those 3 categories. In fact, we recommend using between 3 and 5 categories. This will considerably improve the user's experience of Explore CMS.

### Can I change the order in which the categories are shown in Explore?

From Explore CMS, no. But don't worry, because the order will already have been agreed with the managers of your OB prior to the launch of the categories.

If you feel like a change is necessary, please inform the person responsible for your OB so that they can manage the change with NOVUM staff.
